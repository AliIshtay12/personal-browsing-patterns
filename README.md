### Motivation
While brainstorming for a project idea, I realized that a significant part of my interaction with the world happens through my web browser. It serves as my gateway to knowledge, entertainment, and exploration. This sparked the idea to analyze my personal browsing history.

The motivation behind this analysis is to uncover patterns and trends in my online activities. By examining the websites I visit and the frequency of my searches, I hope to gain a better understanding of my digital habits, interests, and how I allocate my time across various platforms.

### Data Source
The data for this project is sourced primarily from my browser history, collected through:

1. **History Trends Unlimited Extension**  
   I use Google Chrome as my primary browser, and the majority of the data is gathered using the *History Trends Unlimited* extension. This extension syncs my browsing history to a local database, circumventing Chrome’s approximate 3-month history limit. The extension ensures data privacy by storing all history locally, without sharing it over a network. It allows me to export raw browsing data, providing a detailed record for analysis. Features like search filters further help refine the data for this project. For more information on this tool, visit the extension’s page [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/history-trends-unlimited/pnmchffiealhkdloeffcdnbgdnedheme).

To collect this data, I used the export functionality provided by the *History Trends Unlimited* extension, which generates a detailed dataset from my local history database.

This source offers a rich dataset to analyze patterns and trends in my online activities while maintaining strict privacy by keeping all data stored locally.
